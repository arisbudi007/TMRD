Team Red Miner Event Script
===========================

2023-04-04 Initial version.

Overview
--------
This document describes the simple event script mechanism added in TRM
v0.10.10. It addresses certain situations when you may want to reconfigure
your setup using external scripts at specific triggers. The current list
of events is short as this feature was mainly added to allow external shells
scripts to reconfigure clocks during zil switch mining. Future requests might
lead to more events being added.

Setup
-----
Create a shell script (Linux) or .bat file (Windows). Add an argument with
--event_script=my_event_script.sh or --event_script=my_event_script.bat. This
script will now be called on certain events during the miner execution.

Script Execution
----------------
When the script executes, it is always passed an event name, and possibly an
additional argument. The script will execute synchronously, i.e. the miner will
not continue to execute before the event script has completed.

Events
------
These are the current events fired whenever an event script has been configured:

MINER_START         Fires during the miner startup process. Good for testing
                    your event script. This event has no argument.

PRIMARY_ALGO        Fires when the miner switches to the primary algo. The script
                    could e.g. configure clocks suitable for the main algo being
                    mined.

SECONDARY_ALGO      Fires when the miner switches to the secondary algo (ZIL).
                    The script could e.g. configure clocks suitable for zil/ethash
                    mining.
